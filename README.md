Virtual White Cane Project

Built and programmed a virtual white cane geared towards replacing a traditional version of a white cane. The contraption was mounted on the user's chest and operated autonomously, freeing up both hands of the visually impaired person. This is advantageous to the traditional white cane. The device utilized ultrasonic sensors, gyroscopes, motors and a strain wave gear system to alert the user of incoming obstacles or changes in elevation.

The code has functionality to detect incoming obstacles using the ultrasonic sensors, detect changing elevations using trigonometry, emit audial signals, rotate the ultrasonic sensors using an algoirthm to calculate the relative angles of the two gyroscopes and other intermediary functions necessary for operation.
